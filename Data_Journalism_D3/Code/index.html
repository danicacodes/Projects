          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks & Age and Income</h2>
          <p> As depicted in the chart above, there is a positive correlation between obesity and poverty.
            States like Mississippi and New Mexico, over 28% of their population is obese and 22% of their population live in poverty.
            There are outliers, like New Hampshire and Maryland, where they have significantly less poverty but a lot of obese people.
          </p>
          <p>
            When reviewing % of Obese vs. Household Income, we see that Mississippi again has the lowest median Household Income and
            one of the highest obesity rates in the country.
          </p>
          <p>
            Taking a step further, I would like to see cities' walkability score and/or food culture included in this data set. 
            In Los Angeles, California, for example, their low obesity rate could be attributed to high incomes and also local food culture and walkability.
            New York would have a similar profile. That is, most people walk and don't drive and it's easy to access healthier food. The concept of food deserve
            comes to mind when I think of really rural or poor areas.
